With the rollout of **Flex Pricing (Beta)**, <!--  we're removing our data tiering pricing model. Sumo Logic pricing will now be based on the volume of analytics you generate, not the volume of data you send to Sumo Logic for ingestion. Unlimited log ingest. You're encouraged to send enterprise-wide log data. don't worry about how and when you'll be leveraging that data or tiering it (no penalties or cost overages). More data you send = the better your AI/ML, analytics and insights. Unified storage (what is this?) and unlimited user access. -->
