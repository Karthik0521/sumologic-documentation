Say goodbye to data tiers and hello to Sumo Logic Flex Pricing (Beta), our new unlimited ingest log analytics plan that's based on the volume of analytics you generate from your data, rather than the volume of data you send to Sumo Logic for ingestion.

This new pricing model provides you with an efficient and centralized log analytics architecture where you can manage and scale enterprise-wide cloud-scale log ingestion without the risk of runaway costs (should we say no penalties or cost overages?). With all of your application, infrastructure, and security data and insights unified one place, and unlimited user access, it's easy to collaborate. By removing ingest limitations and enabling an enterprise-wide single source of truth for your analytics, this allows Dev, Sec, and Ops teams to troubleshoot faster and accelerate release velocity while delivering reliable and secure digital experiences.

The more log data ingested, the more accurate your analytics and ML/AI outcomes.
